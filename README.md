# Job-Tracker

This program was made using PySimpleGUI, and the main purpose is to make job tracking easier so it's easier to input the data to excel sheet. The program takes in user input fields: Employer, Position, Status, Link, Date Applied, and Pay and automatically put the data into the given excel sheet (my updated excel sheet is not provided on github due to privacy reason).
